MyLifeIsOpen

Released under the New BSD License

This project aims to give users an easy way to create sites like 
TextsFromLastNight, My Life Is Average, F My Life, etc. Currently, it is
very heavily based on the first site to use the framework: My Life Is Geek.
Over the coming months, it will be generalized and abstracted from MLIG. 

Django:

This project relies on Django 1.2.* for now.  We will be upgrading as
stable version are pushed out.

Admin Site:

Username is 'admin', password is 'password', email is admin@admin.com
